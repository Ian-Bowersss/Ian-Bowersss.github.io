## Browser History 1
Browser History 1 focused on the creation of a basic web page of inputting text, links, and photos. 

This WOD took me the most amount of time and ended up being the most challenging. This WOD had the most tasks in creating all the headings, inputting all the paragraphs, creating a table of contents, and formatting the images. For my first attempt, I ended up not finishing within the time mainly due to creating the table of contents. But first creating the tags and inputting the text weren't too much of a challenge as the code was fairly simple. The first challenge that got to me was setting links within the paragraphs. This was challenging as I couldn't figure out how to make the URL clickable through a specified word. I then later figured out that to give the word a link it had to be inside the arrows (<>) to show up as a blue clickable link. Creating the table of contents is where I ultimately failed on time and needed the screencast to assist with my problems. I had the itemized list coded properly I just didn't know how to code so when you clicked the contents it would take you to that specific paragraph. 

Using the screencast I was able to complete this WOD on my third attempt with an RX performance.  
## Browser History 2
Browser History 2 was about CSS and styling the web page that we just created. 

This WOD was very interesting to do as it was quite fun using CSS to style and customize the webpage. The first thing that I had to overcome was that CSS is a very different coding structure to HTML. In that, you have to specify what sections of the code you want to change like the body or the heading tags (h2 or h1). Changing the colors, headings, and margins of the web page wasn't too hard as specifying what to do in CSS is pretty straightforward. However, changing the fonts of the text is the reason I DNF'd and had to watch the screencast. I was very lost because my font wasn't changing no matter what I did. I discovered quickly in the screencast that I had to use a Google link to use the specific fonts for my webpage. Once implementing those links the fonts changed immediately and the WOD was complete.

Watching the screencast I finished this WOD on my second attempt with an RX performance.
## Browser History 3
Browser History 3 was the shortest of the three focusing on columns and formatting of the table of contents. 

Formatting a horizontal table of contents was very easy for me with the help of Intellisense. I was able to find the right inline code to make it horizontal and I just spaced out the margins to give it a cleaner look. Formatting the columns was very difficult and left me very lost. I was able to get the paragraphs into columns however they were out of order and not in line with each other. I had to take a peak at the screencast to quickly realize I had to ID each of the paragraphs to give them columns. Using a different set of code I established what ID I would be changing and used margins to separate the text into neat columns. Once that was done I noticed the columns weren't even on a line as the middle one was slightly higher than the rest. This left me stumped in figuring out how to make them even. Looking at the screencast I was directed to use "padding" to make each column the same which worked perfectly.

This WOD was completed on my second attempt with a performance of RX.
