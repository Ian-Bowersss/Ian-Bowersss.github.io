## Invoice 1 WOD
For this WOD we were tasked with creating a sales receipt for 5 different products using variables and algebraic expressions to compute a total for the products purchased. For more information here is a [link.](https://dport96.github.io/ITM352/morea/060.expressions-operators/experience-invoice1.html)

Firstly, creating all my variables for the products went smoothly as well as using mathematical expressions to get my tax and subtotals. The thing that slowed me down was how to input my assigned variables into my data table. This is where I got stuck and had to look at the screencast for some assistance. Going through the assignment I quickly noticed all the different variables that were needed. So before this WOD, I brushed up on my knowledge of creating and assigning variables. This helped me efficiently code my variables promptly while attempting the WOD. For future WODs, I need to make sure I review the readings for the techniques that are required for the next WOD. While attempting this Invoice 1 WOD I didn't review all the techniques, more specifically creating and inputting tables. Therefore, I struggled to assign my variables within the data table; it would have been helpful to review how to input string assignments for the given data table.
