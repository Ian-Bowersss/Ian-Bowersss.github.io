## Progress Report
1. My programming skills have greatly improved in the following ways:

   - I can create complex applications, understand algorithmic concepts, enhance problem-solving capabilities, efficient in writing clean and commented code, and improved debugging skills.
     

2. I need to work on the following to improve my programming skills:

   - I need to improve my confidence in the application of writing code so that I can understand how the computer will think and output my code.
     
   
3. I have learned a lot from doing WODs and I can do them without copying the screencast:

    - During the beginning of the semester I would be stuck on the WODs and having the screencast was very handy to look up some mistakes I may have made. As the semester went by and 
     screencasts were no longer available I found myself struggling with the WODs. Taking more time to go through and review was the instructions were asking me to do I was able to pull 
     through and finish up the rest of the WODs.

   
4. The labs have helped me learn and I am able to complete them with confidence:

    - I have probably learned the most from doing the labs for the fact that we do them in class and Professor Port is there to go through it with us and ask questions.
      

5. I learned a lot from my experience doing Assignment 1 and feel ready to work on Assignment 2:

    - Assignment 1 was a very new and difficult experience at first. But by asking for help from the TA's and friends in the class I was able to learn so much more by taking bits and pieces       of their knowledge to make my Assignment 1 better.
      

6. I think the class can be improved to help my learning in the following ways:

   - Making sure that all of the students are on the same page before moving too in-depth with the lesson will be good in making sure everyone is caught up and working on the same thing.
      

7. What helps me the most in class are (WODs, Labs, class website, screencasts, readings, quizzes, one-on-one help, working with classmates, etc.):

   - Using the screencast effectively and honorably when I am 100% stuck and need help offered some of the best assistance. Getting help from others in the class and talking with the TA 
     extremely helped me get through some of the more complex assignments this class has to offer.
