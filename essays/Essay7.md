## Reflection 
[Assignment2](https://dport96.github.io/ITM352/morea/150.Assignment2/experience-Assignment2.html) was the second iteration of assignment 1 where this time the addition of login and registration pages was implemented. In this assignment, I learned how to match user logins and create registration data that would be saved when the user would input valid data. Code was also used to ensure that email and password data would be valid. For this assignment, I did not work together with a partner rather I just collaborated with others. When I needed help I would ask my classmates around to see if they had the same trouble. One instance was another classmate and I had trouble displaying the errors on the page but we eventually were able to figure out a solution tailored to our different code. Developing assignment 2 was different than 1 because you're essentially building off of assignment 1 so having a quality working assignment 1 made this assignment much easier and less complicated. Most of my time was spent on testing and debugging as the code itself wasn't too extensive rather it was hard to get it implemented and working correctly. If I could go back in time I would go a lot slower in adding code and testing my store each time I added a line of code. In the beginning, I would try to add a lot of code hoping for it to work all at once, but that was not the case hence the reason debugging took most of my time.
