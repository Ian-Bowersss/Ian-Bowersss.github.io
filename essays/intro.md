## Why Management Information Systems?
Initially, at the start of my college career, I pursued a degree in computer science. After taking some classes it was clear that my interest went above strictly coding. My passion for technology has always been more of a hands-on approach to troubleshooting that information technology careers specialize in.

This is when I came across the Management Information Systems program offered at Shidler College of Business. This program focuses more on the application of technology in a business setting where you're looking to bridge the gap between technology and the business world. This career path is more suited for my goals in the future and through learning MIS I plan to effectively demonstrate the skills I learned on the technological and business side at the professional level.
